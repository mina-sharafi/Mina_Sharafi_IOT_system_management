Smart Home Automation System

Introduction

This project is a Smart Home Automation System that allows users to create groups of devices (e.g., lights, fans, doors), control them via MQTT messaging, and manage them efficiently through an Admin Panel.

Features

Device Management: Create, add, and manage smart devices.

Grouping: Organize devices into groups (e.g., living_room, kitchen).

MQTT Communication: Devices communicate through an MQTT broker.

Bulk Device Creation: Quickly add multiple devices to a group.

Remote Control: Turn devices on/off and adjust settings.

Status Monitoring: Retrieve the status of all devices in a group.

Automation (Upcoming): Auto-control lights based on time.
